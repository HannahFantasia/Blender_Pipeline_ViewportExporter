# Demo-Exporter
Exporting blender files very fast as a demo render in my pipeline.

**Install just the .py file as an addon and dont be stupid about it**

Click F3, type in Master and click on Demo Exporter.


Necessary folder structure:

>Task
>>001.00_asset
>>>Source
>>>>001.00_asset_001.blend

>>001.00_asset
>>>Master
>>>>001.00_asset_Master.blend

>>001.00_asset
>>>Demo
>>>>001.00_asset_001.mp4
