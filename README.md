# Exporter
Exporting blender files very fast as a demo render or master export in my pipeline.

**Install just the .py file as an addon and dont be stupid about it**

Click F3, type in Master or Demo and click on Demo Exporter or Master Exporter.


Necessary folder structure:

`Task/tyPe/Shotnumber/Content`

>Task
>>Source
>>>001.00_asset
>>>>001.00_asset_001.blend

>>Master
>>>001.00_asset
>>>>001.00_asset_Master.blend (created file)

>>Demo
>>>001.00_asset
>>>>001.00_asset_001.mp4 (created file)
