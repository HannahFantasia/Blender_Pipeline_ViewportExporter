# Demo-Exporter
Exporting blender files very fast as a demo render in my pipeline.

**Install just the .py file as an addon and dont be stupid about it**

Click F3, type in Master and click on Demo Exporter.


Necessary folder structure:

>Task
>>Source
>>>001_asset
>>>>asset_001.blend

>>Master (optional but I prefer to have one)
>>>001_asset
>>>>001_asset_master.blend

>>Demo
>>>001_asset
>>>>001_asset_001.mp4 (the file being created)
